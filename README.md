# Playground _(powershell edition)_

Welcome to a virtual dumpster of code, have fun diving.

## Words of caution
Like all code, don't copy and paste without understanding, but exercise a little extra caution here.  I did say it might not be done.

## FAQ
### Why a playground?
I write a ton of code that is not refined enough to post, or not fully working/finished, or not widely useable.  But sometimes there are good bits in there that never make it anywhere else

### Why bother sharing it all?
My thoughts also, and why there was never a Playground before.  Some of the code is useful, some ideas, or sometimes a great starting point or useful to someone.  Maybe someone can fork it and turn it into gold.

### Will the code be useable?
Maybe.  I will post code that I never got working here.  I will post some code that I abandoned, before (or after) it worked.  Although, most of this will probably be code I wrote for one specific use case.  The code will likely be stuff that I never built in proper debugging, trapping _(try and catch, try and except)_, data validation etc.

### How will I know the state of the code
I will try, with no promises, to include a readme or comments at the top to give the last known state.

### Why is there so little here?
Assuming this is the future and I have added something... I am going to add code that I create going forward, I am not going to sift through the years of stuff as often there are references that need to be cleaned out, etc. (not passwords, __AVOID__ putting passwords in your code.
